## About This Project

Manager Your Compnay is a command line application that allows for anyone to manage a company by using persisting data techniques to view employees, roles, departments, add additional employees, role, departments, as well as update employees

As someone who would like to own their own company one day, having this application allows me to easily keep track of my ever expanding company through my own needs

I used mysql for the database, Inquirer to prompt users for input, consoletable to log out the sql tables in an easy to view manner, and node to manage my packages, as well as vanilla JavaScript to handle all logicality.

Some challenges I faced include connecting the the database, querying the database as well as asynchronous function of mysql2, as well as setting up primary and foreign keys properly.
